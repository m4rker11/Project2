# Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Key Individuals to Predict Stock Prices

The purpose of this project is to create an application that performs a sentiment analysis of specific Twitter user tweets to determine if those tweets had any effect on a stock price increasing or decreasing. The front end of the application is a webpage that allows a user to input a Twitter handle and a stock/cryptocurrency. Once submitted, the current pricing trends are shown through Tradingview and the back end of the application retrieves the Twitter ID number of the username that was entered to return tweets from that user. From there, the tweets are run through a sentiment analysis model to ultimately determine if the tweet sentiments had any influence on the prices of the stocks that were tweeted about.
